# stl
STL's are optimized for visualization and simulation with low vertice counts. Find 3D print ready STL's in the main project repository either from the archived CAD model or the STL folder.

To update STL's from main CAD model, export meshes with the following parameters (using Fusion 360):
	Format: STL (Binary)
	Unit Type: Meter
	Refinement: Low
	 
Use Fusion 360 to determine the STL's origin to perform joint offset calculations.
